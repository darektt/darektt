## Hi there 👋

Hi there, I'm Darekt! 👋

I am a 21-year-old student  with a deep interest in the intersection of human cognition and technology.

### 🧠 Psychology & Philosophy
I am currently studying **Psychology**, a field I am deeply passionate about. My curiosity for the human mind is mirrored in my reading habits: I am a big fan of **Franz Kafka** and **classical literature** in general, and I have a strong interest in **Philosophy**.

### 💻 Technical Skills
I enjoy structured and logical thinking, which I apply to programming:
* **Languages:** Python and Java.
* **Typesetting:** I am learning  **LaTeX** for creating professional, high-quality academic notes and documents.

### 🃏 Also...
When I'm not studying or coding, you'll likely find me at the **poker** table, where I enjoy the blend of strategy, psychology, and probability.
